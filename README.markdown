## Duality First Person Shooter

### The Plan
We are a group of hobbiest developers who wanted to work on a FPS game which fit out style of gameplay.
The game is in set in a post appocolyptic enviroment, with a hl2 style gameplay. The game is to be licenced under the GPL licence.

### The Game
The game is based on the BlendElf engine, which is a 3D game engine, we chose this because it's shiney, has physics already implimented in the engine and it is cross platform as well as scripted in the amazing language LUA.

If you have any of the following skills we would be interested in your help developing the game:

* Previous game development experience.
* Modeling using Blender.
* Experience in graphics and artwork.
* Lua scripting skills.

Even if you have none of these skills and would like to help anyway, that would be great, the more help we can get the better.
